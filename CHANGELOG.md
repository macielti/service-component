## 7.4.3 - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- Breaking Change: Error handling for request body validation has been updated.
    - The error code for schema validation failures is now `"invalid-request-body-payload"`.
    - Error messages for invalid request bodies are improved for clarity.
    - Error details in responses are now consistently stringified.
- Schema Coercion: String values in JSON request bodies are now automatically coerced to keywords when the schema
  expects a keyword, improving compatibility with `EqSchema`.

## 6.4.3 - 2026-01-02

### Added

- Add to interceptor `query-params-schema` coercion support from `String` to `LocalDate`.

## 6.4.2 - 2026-01-02

## 5.4.2 - 2025-12-25

### Changed

- **Major Pedestal Upgrade**: Migrated from Pedestal 0.7.x to 0.8.x, adopting the new connector-based API.
    - Refactored `service-component.core` to use `io.pedestal.connector` and `io.pedestal.http.jetty`, replacing the
      deprecated `io.pedestal.http` API.
    - Updated interceptors and test utilities to use modern namespaces like `io.pedestal.connector` and
      `io.pedestal.service.interceptors`.
- **Interceptors**: The default set of interceptors was updated to align with the new Pedestal 0.8 architecture and
  improve error handling.
